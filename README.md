### Hi there 👋

🚀 I'm a Computer Engineering graduate with a passion for backend development . After completing my degree, I pursued a full-stack Java development training to deepen my understanding of scalable applications and software architecture.

💻 My core skills include Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, REST APIs. I'm also comfortable with Git, Maven, and agile development practices.

🌐 Currently, I'm exploring opportunities where I can contribute to impactful software projects and grow as a backend. I'm especially interested in roles involving microservices, cloud deployment, and real-world problem solving.

🎯 I'm a quick learner, proactive team player, and committed to continuous learning 

📬 Open to internships, full-time roles, or project collaborations in Java backend. Let’s connect!
